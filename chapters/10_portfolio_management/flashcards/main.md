## Investment Strategies

### Strategic Asset Allocation
Q: What is strategic asset allocation?
A: A long-term investment approach that establishes target allocations for different asset classes based on investment objectives and risk tolerance.

Q: What factors influence strategic asset allocation?
A: Investment objectives, risk tolerance, time horizon, tax considerations, and investment constraints.

Q: How does rebalancing relate to strategic asset allocation?
A: Rebalancing maintains the target allocations by periodically adjusting portfolio weights back to their strategic targets.

### Tactical Asset Allocation
Q: What is tactical asset allocation?
A: A short-term investment approach that adjusts portfolio allocations based on market conditions and opportunities.

Q: What is sector rotation?
A: A tactical strategy that shifts investments between different market sectors based on economic cycles and market conditions.

Q: How does market timing differ from tactical allocation?
A: Market timing attempts to predict market movements, while tactical allocation makes adjustments based on current market conditions and opportunities.

## Portfolio Construction

### Asset Classes
Q: What are the main asset classes in portfolio construction?
A: Equities, fixed income, cash equivalents, real estate, commodities, and alternative investments.

Q: What is the role of international securities in portfolio construction?
A: They provide geographic diversification and exposure to different economic conditions and growth opportunities.

Q: How do alternative investments fit into portfolio construction?
A: They offer diversification benefits and potential returns that may be uncorrelated with traditional asset classes.

### Diversification
Q: What is the purpose of diversification?
A: To reduce portfolio risk by spreading investments across different assets, sectors, and geographic regions.

Q: What is correlation in portfolio management?
A: A statistical measure of how different investments move in relation to each other, used to assess diversification benefits.

Q: What are concentration limits?
A: Maximum allowable allocations to individual securities, sectors, or asset classes to manage risk.

## Risk Management

### Risk Measurement
Q: What is volatility?
A: A measure of the dispersion of investment returns, used to assess risk.

Q: What is Value at Risk (VaR)?
A: A statistical measure of the maximum potential loss in a portfolio over a specific time period.

Q: What is risk budgeting?
A: The process of allocating risk across different portfolio components based on their expected returns and risk characteristics.

### Risk Monitoring
Q: What is stress testing?
A: A risk management technique that evaluates portfolio performance under extreme market conditions.

Q: What is scenario analysis?
A: The process of evaluating how a portfolio might perform under different market scenarios.

Q: What are risk limits?
A: Maximum allowable levels of risk exposure for different portfolio components or strategies.

## Portfolio Monitoring

### Performance Analysis
Q: What is attribution analysis?
A: The process of breaking down portfolio performance to identify the sources of returns.

Q: What are risk-adjusted returns?
A: Returns that are adjusted for the level of risk taken to achieve them.

Q: What is benchmark comparison?
A: The process of comparing portfolio performance against a relevant market index or peer group.

### Rebalancing
Q: What triggers portfolio rebalancing?
A: Significant deviations from target allocations, market movements, or client circumstances.

Q: What are the costs of rebalancing?
A: Transaction costs, tax implications, and market impact costs.

Q: How often should portfolios be rebalanced?
A: Based on a predetermined schedule or when allocations deviate significantly from targets.

## Special Considerations

### Tax Management
Q: What is tax-loss harvesting?
A: The practice of selling investments at a loss to offset capital gains and reduce taxes.

Q: What is tax-efficient investing?
A: Investment strategies that minimize tax impact while pursuing investment objectives.

Q: What is tax lot selection?
A: The process of choosing which shares to sell to optimize tax consequences.

### Client Communication
Q: What should be included in performance reporting?
A: Returns, risk metrics, attribution analysis, and comparison to benchmarks.

Q: What is the purpose of strategy updates?
A: To keep clients informed about portfolio changes and market conditions affecting their investments.

Q: Why is documentation important in portfolio management?
A: It provides a record of decisions, communications, and compliance with investment policies.
